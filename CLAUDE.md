## Architecture Notes
- Game state is a single global `game` object (defined in game.js)
- Data definitions are global constants (EQUIPMENT, STAFF, CLASS_INSTRUCTORS, SKILL_TREE, GYM_ZONES, NEIGHBORHOODS, VIP_MEMBERS, SUPPLEMENTS, RIVAL_GYMS, TAB_WALKTHROUGHS, WIKI_CONTENT, etc. in data.js)
- Game loop runs via `setInterval(gameTick, 1000)` - one tick per second
- Game tick is paused during tutorial (`if (!game.tutorialDone) { updateUI(); return; }`)
- All rendering functions follow pattern: `renderXxx()` reads from `game` state and writes innerHTML
- Save system: auto-save every 30 ticks to localStorage, cloud save every 60 ticks to Firestore
- Offline progression: `calculateOfflineProgress()` in game.js, capped at 8 hours. Calculates net income (income - salaries - op costs), completes all timers (equipment upgrades/repairs, zones, staff training, classes, champion training), processes marketing campaigns (always-on costs + members + rep, burst completion), passive rep from members, auto-members from staff, champion fatigue recovery. Shows `showOfflineReport()` modal with full breakdown on return.
- **Branch system (idle/passive franchise)**: You actively manage ONE gym — the entire `game.*` state IS that gym (no swapping). It lives in `game.mainNeighborhoodId` (default `'palermo'`). Additional branches are lightweight PASSIVE income nodes: `game.branches[id] = { id, neighborhoodId, name, level, openedAt }`. No per-branch level/equipment/staff, no switching. Each branch's passive income = `branchIncomeBasis(hood)/BRANCH_INCOME_PAYBACK × (1 + (level-1)×BRANCH_LEVEL_STEP) × franchiseMult` and flows straight into `game.money` + `game.totalMoneyEarned` (online tick every 10s + offline). `upgradeBranch()` ("Ampliar") raises a branch's level. `migrateBranchesToPassive()` converts old "active-swap" saves (full-state branches) into lightweight nodes on load, deriving level from old equipment.
- Tuning constants in game.js: `BRANCH_INCOME_PAYBACK=1500`, `BRANCH_LEVEL_STEP=0.25`, `BRANCH_UPGRADE_BASE=0.5`. `getTotalGymCount()` = 1 (main) + passive branches.
- Neighborhoods differ by `unlockCost`/`reqLevel`/flavor only; pricier zone = more passive income. Their old per-stat multipliers (rentMult/memberMult/vipChanceMult/maxMembersCap) still apply ONLY to the main gym via `getActiveNeighborhood()` (Palermo = neutral).
- Skills, champion, achievements, stats, money, level/XP all persist globally on the single managed gym.
- Equipment state: `{ level, brokenUntil, upgradingUntil }` — tracks breakdown and construction
- Staff state: `{ hired, level, trainingUntil, sickUntil, extras: [] }` — tracks training and illness
- Zone building state: `game.zoneBuilding = { zoneId: timestamp }`
- Champion state: `game.champion = { recruited, name, stats, level, xp, fatigue, equipment, trainingUntil, trainingStat, wins, losses, injuredUntil, injurySeverity }` — global. No SVG, no energy system. Uses fatigue (not energy). `injuredUntil` (time-based, set by Grand Tournaments) blocks ALL train/compete until it expires.
- **Grand Tournaments (Grandes Torneos)**: high-risk "heist-style" champion events ABOVE the 6 normal competitions. `GRAND_TOURNAMENTS`/`GRAND_PREP_ITEMS` in data.js. State: `game.grandTournaments[id] = { wins, losses, cooldownUntil }` + `game.grandPrep[id] = { pasajes, nutricion, medico, concentracionUntil }`. Loop: buy prep items (raise Preparación%) → `attemptGrandTournament(id)` (pays entry fee, rolls win via `getGrandWinChance`, rolls injury via `getGrandInjuryChance`, consumes prep) → multi-day cooldown + possible injury (`applyChampionInjury`, time-only recovery). Tick checks `checkChampionInjury`/`checkGrandConcentracion`. UI in `renderGrandTournaments()` (systems.js) + `showGrandResult()` modal. Logic in game.js after `championFatigueTick`.
- Instructor state: `game.instructors[classId] = { hired, level }` — one per class
- Tab tracking: `game.tabLastVisited = { tabId: timestamp }` for reminders; `game.tabsSeen = { tabId: true }` for first-visit walkthroughs

## Auth Flow
1. Page loads → Auth screen (login/register/guest)
2. Login/Register → Firebase Auth → Check for cloud save
3. New user → Gym name modal → Tutorial (game tick paused, $100 starting money)
4. Returning user → Load cloud save → Offline progression → Summary modal → Game resumes
5. Guest mode → localStorage only, no cloud sync
6. Account settings accessible from Settings tab (change username, password)

## Firebase Config
- Firebase config is in js/auth.js (top of file)
- Replace placeholder values with actual Firebase project config
- Required Firebase services: Authentication, Firestore
- Firestore collections: `users` (profiles), `saves` (game data)

## Key Game Systems (26 total)
1. **Máquinas/Equipment** (12 items) - Buy/upgrade, each gives income/members/capacity. Level cap = player level. Can break down randomly.
2. **Staff** (8 types) - Hire + train levels. Passive bonuses. Can get sick randomly. Multiple copies via extras.
3. **Competitions** (6 tiers) - Unified in champion tab. Normal competitions before recruiting, 2x rewards with champion. Shared cooldowns.
4. **Achievements** (76) - Auto-checked conditions, grant XP. Covers all systems.
5. **City/Franchise** (6 neighborhoods) - Manage ONE main gym; open extra branches in Buenos Aires neighborhoods (Palermo, La Boca, Caballito, Belgrano, Recoleta, San Telmo) as pure PASSIVE income generators (no management, no chaos, no costs). Pricier/higher-level neighborhoods yield more passive income. "Ampliar" invests to raise a branch's income (+25%/level). Franchise stars based on global total earnings (+25% income each).
6. **Daily Bonus** - 7-day streak cycle with escalating rewards
7. **Daily Missions** (3/day) - Random from pool of 8 types, bonus for all 3
8. **Random Events** (every 5-10 min) - 39 events with player choices. DECLARATIVE outcomes: each choice specifies signed tier magnitudes (`money`/`rep`/`xp`/`members` = ±1/2/3, or a `gamble:{p,win,lose}`, or `special:'curestaff'|'randomsupp'`). Resolved at runtime by `resolveEventSpec`/`applyEventDeltas`/`fmtEventDeltas` (game.js) so ALL outcomes scale with the player's economy. No hardcoded magic numbers, no effect functions in data.
9. **Gym Classes** (8 types) - Real-time duration + cooldown, costs money. Each class has a dedicated instructor that must be hired to unlock it. Instructor levels 1-5 boost income +20%/level. Instructors earn 15% commission on gross class income (no fixed salary). Quality bonus from equipment + instructor levels.
10. **Marketing Campaigns** (10 total: 4 always-on + 6 burst) - Always-on: toggle on/off, continuous cost+member generation (Flyers, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google Ads). Burst: one-time with cooldown (YouTube, Radio, TV, Celebrity, Patrocinio, Gala). ROI insights for active campaigns.
11. **Tutorial** - 16-step interactive walkthrough. Game tick paused during tutorial. Action steps force user to click (navigate tabs, buy first equipment). Smart tooltip positioning (below/above/side/center). Player starts with $100 for first purchase.
12. **Skill Tree** (6 branches x 5 skills = 30) - Permanent upgrades, persist through prestige. Costs $2.5K-$15M, levels 3-25.
13. **Instalaciones/Expansion** (6 zones) - Capacity + income per zone, construction timers (3min-2h), buy property option
14. **VIP Members** (16 types) - Spawn every 4-7 min, show detailed req status (met/unmet)
15. **Supplements** (12 types) - Temporary buffs with tolerance system: repeated use in same game day reduces effectiveness (4 levels: 100%→85%→65%→45%). Tolerance decays 1 level per game day of inactivity. No paying to skip — must wait.
16. **Rival Gyms** (6 NPCs) - Steal members passively, promo (temp) or defeat (permanent bonus), costs scale with level
17. **Leaderboard** - Firebase-synced global ranking by total money earned, in Prestige tab
18. **Staff Training** - Level up staff with money + time, each level boosts their effect
19. **Equipment Breakdown** - Random breakdowns, repair costs money + time, cleaner reduces chance
20. **Construction Timers** - Equipment upgrades (20s * level) and zone building take real time
21. **Champion** - Recruit a fighter (name only, no visual). RPG stat sheet with 6 trainable stats: Fuerza (prize boost), Resistencia (reduces fatigue from competing), Velocidad (win chance), Técnica (prize/rep mult), Stamina (fatigue recovery speed), Mentalidad (win bonus vs hard opponents). Fatigue system: train=+25, compete=+35. At fatigue≥75 (AGOTADO), can't act. No paying to rest — time is the only recovery. Equipment (8 items, 4 slots). Persists through prestige.
22. **Tab Walkthroughs** - First-visit blocking modal for 15 tabs. Explains system, shows 3-5 tips, links to wiki section. Tracked in `game.tabsSeen`. Only fires after tutorial is done.
23. **Wiki** - In-game knowledge base tab (📖). 17 collapsible sections covering all game systems. Full-text search. Accessible from walkthroughs or directly from sidebar. `renderWiki()` + `searchWiki()` + `toggleWikiSection()` in systems.js.
24. **Offline Progression** - `calculateOfflineProgress()` in game.js. Cap 8 hours. Processes: net income, all timer completions, marketing campaigns, passive rep, auto-members, champion fatigue recovery. Shows detailed modal (`showOfflineReport()`) with economy/construction/marketing/growth/champion sections.
25. **Balance Panel** - SimCity-style financial overview modal. `openBalancePanel()` / `renderBalancePanel()` in systems.js. Shows: income breakdown per equipment/zone/rival, all multipliers (skills, staff, members, prestige, supplements, decoration), expense breakdown per staff salary/rent/utilities/campaigns, net income /s, daily projection.
26. **Grandes Torneos** - High-risk "heist-style" champion circuit (Copa Élite 24h cooldown, Mundial de Leyendas 3-day cooldown), shown below normal competitions in the Champion tab. Prepare BEFORE entering (Pasajes obligatorio, Concentración timed, Plan Nutricional, Kit Médico) to raise Preparación% → higher win chance (+35% at 100%) + lower injury risk. Entry fee + prep are committed/consumed on attempt (win or lose). Injury sidelines the champion for hours (time-only recovery, no train/compete). Rewards scale with economy (income-floored) + permanent player titles. Well-prepared = win ~95% / injury ~2%; unprepared = win ~80% / injury ~20%. Validated in `tools/sim_grand_tournaments.js`.
26. **Fama / Tienda de Prestigio** (🌟 Fama tab, unlock lvl 5) - Reputation is now a SPENDABLE currency (was a dead number that only gated competitions). `FAME_SHOP` in data.js: **4 boosts** (temp: x2 income, x2 rep, x2 class income, +50% member attraction), **5 perks** (permanent leveled: +6% income, -4% costs, -12% rival steal, +5% capacity, +15% VIP spawn speed), **3 unlocks** (one-shot milestones gated by `reqLifetime`: Patrocinio +15% income, Salón VIP +50% VIP rewards, Leyenda +10% income & raises passive floor cap 15%→30%). All in `renderFameShop()` (systems.js). **Pricing is rate-based** (`getFameBoostCost`/`getFamePerkCost`/`getFameUnlockCost` = `getReputationPerSecond() × seconds`) so cost stays ~constant in "minutes of fame" at every level — no flat numbers going vestigial. Perks escalate ×1.8/level. **Passive floor**: `getReputationFloorBonus()` = logarithmic income bonus from LIFETIME rep (`getReputationLifetime() = reputation + reputationSpent`, so spending never lowers the floor), capped +15% (+30% with Leyenda). State: `game.reputationSpent`, `game.famePerks{id:lvl}`, `game.fameBoosts{id:expiresAt}`, `game.fameUnlocks{id:true}`. Hooks: `getFameIncomeMult` in getIncomePerSecond; `getFamePerkEffect` in getMaxMembers/getEquipCost/overhead/getMembersAttracted; `getActiveFameBoosts` in repTick/getClassReward/getMembersAttracted; VIP spawn+reward in systems.js. Migration-safe (deepMerge defaults + `normalizeFameData`); pure buff for existing players (their accumulated rep becomes spendable + gives a floor).

## Home Tab Stats
- Stats grid shows 6 boxes: Ingreso Neto /seg, Gastos Totales /seg, Miembros (actual/cap), Reputación, Total Ganado, Categoría
- All monetary stats unified to per-second display
- "📊 Balance Contable" button opens detailed financial breakdown modal
- `getCampaignCostsPerSecond()` helper includes always-on campaign costs in total expenses

## Balance & Economy
- XP curve: `100 * 1.40^(level-1)`. Repeatable XP scales with level to avoid a mid/late wall: classes use `levelScale = 1+0.2*(level-1)`; competitions (normal + champion, win + loss) use `1+0.15*(level-1)`; missions `1+0.2*(level-1)`.
- Operating costs (per game day = 600s): CONTINUOUS rent ramp, no cliff. `level<=5 → level*800`; `level>5 → 5*800 + (level-5)*rentPerLevel` (rentPerLevel=2000). Plus extra-zone rent + utilities (`60/equip level/day`). Neighborhood rentMult applies (Palermo=1.0). `baseRent` constant is legacy/unused.
- **Income overhead** (`getIncomeOverheadPerSecond`, in `getOperatingCostsPerSecond`): "servicios e impuestos" = `OPERATING_COSTS.overheadRate` (0.18) × gross income/s. This SCALES with income so expenses stay a meaningful fraction at every stage — flat rent/utilities/salaries are ~1% of income by mid-game otherwise. Reducible by the Manager (`costReduction × levelMult`). Flows into tick, home stats, offline, and the balance panel automatically via `getOperatingCostsPerSecond`.
- Property purchase ($8M, lvl 18) eliminates rent
- Equipment level capped at player level. Cost curve (costMult 1.85→2.5) is intentionally steep — players buy breadth (all tiers at low-mid level) and the income-per-$ equilibrium self-balances; not meant to be maxed to the level cap.
- Member count is driven by CAPACITY (equipment capacityPerLevel + zones + staff + supplements), not by attraction (membersPerLevel is an intentional surplus that keeps you full). Palermo's `maxMembersCap` raised 500→2500 so capacity is the real driver and the member income bonus can reach its ×3 ceiling (≈1000 members). The old 500 cap was vestigial from the multi-branch design.
- Equipment baseCost scales exponentially by tier: $50 (dumbbells) → $200 → $600 → $1.5K → $4K → $10K → $25K → $75K → $180K → $450K → $1.2M → $3.5M (spa). costMult also increases for higher tiers (1.85→2.5).
- Event outcome scaling (game.js `evMoney`/`evRep`/`evXp`/`evMembers`): money gains = seconds-of-income (tiers ~40/110/280s, floored); money COSTS = same but capped at 12/25/45% of current cash (never bankrupts); rep ~12/28/55 ×(1+0.22·(lvl-1)); xp ~35/90/190 ×(1+0.18·(lvl-1)); members = 4/9/18% of cap (floored). Stays meaningful early AND late.
- Competition cooldowns (compressed for daily engagement): 10m / 20m / 40m / 1.5h / 3h / 6h (local→world). Competition XP (normal+champion, win+loss) scales ×(1+0.15·(lvl-1)).
- Supplement costs scale: +15% per level above requirement
- Rival costs scale: +20% per level above requirement
- Game day = 600 ticks = 10 min real time
- Timers auto-refresh every 2 seconds in game tick
- Zone costs: $50K (1st floor) to $15M (arena)
- Skill tree costs: $2.5K to $15M, levels 3-25
- Construction: equipment 20s*level, zones 3min-2h
- Chaos: 0.3% equipment breakdown/30s, 0.5% staff illness/60s
- Class costs scale +15%/level, rewards scale +20%/level with quality bonus
- Instructor hire costs: $300 (yoga) to $25K (swimming), upgrade cost = hireCost * level * 2.5
- Instructor commission: 15% of gross class income, deducted on completion
- Champion fatigue recovery: `3 + floor(stamina * 0.6)` points per 30 ticks. Fatigue gate (≥75 = no train/compete) is ENFORCED in `trainChampion`/`championCompete` + UI. `mentalidad` win bonus scales with difficulty: `×0.01×(1.5 - winChance)`. Champion comp money has an income-scaled floor (`income/s × xpReward/50`).
- Grandes Torneos tuning (data.js): Copa Élite (`entryFee 250K`, cooldown 24h, baseWinChance 0.30, injury 0.25→0.06, maxHours 4, reward floor = income/s × 600); Mundial (`entryFee 1.5M`, cooldown 3d, baseWinChance 0.22, injury 0.40→0.10, maxHours 12, floor = income/s × 1800). Prep items cost `entryFee × costMult`; readiness sums to 100 (pasajes 20 required, concentración 40 timed, nutrición 20, médico 20+halves injury). Win chance = `baseWinChance + statBonus + readiness×0.35 + skillBonus − fatiguePenalty`; injury chance = `baseChance − readiness×(base−min) − resistencia×0.004`, ×0.5 if médico. `GRAND_FATIGUE_PER_ATTEMPT=55`. Circuit nets ~0.6% of income/hour (a treat, not the economy).
- Classes income rides the economy (`getClassReward` multiplies by `staffMult × memberBonus` + supplement `classIncomeMult`) so it doesn't go vestigial vs scaling equipment income. Instructor upgrade cost mult 1.5.
- Rivals: `memberSteal` drains a PERCENTAGE of actual members (`getRivalMemberSteal × 0.0025 × rivalStealMult`, capped 30%), applied in `getMembersAttracted` after the cap — flat steal used to be absorbed by the attraction surplus. Defeating a rival removes its share + gives an income/capacity bonus that's amplified by the full multiplier stack.
- Manager `costReduction` stacks across copies (`getStaffTotalEffect`) + scales with level, capped 60%, applied to equipment cost + the income overhead. Several supplements/skills had flat (non-scaling) effects converted/augmented with `incomeMult` riders so they stay relevant late.
- Neighborhood unlock costs: $0 (Palermo) → $500K (La Boca) → $800K (Caballito) → $1.5M (Belgrano) → $3M (Recoleta) → $5M (San Telmo)
- Neighborhood rent multipliers: 0.6 (La Boca) to 1.8 (Recoleta)
- Passive branch income: `unlockCost / 1500` per sec at level 1 (≈25 min payback), +25% per "Ampliar" level. Does NOT scale with franchise stars (avoids stars×branches runaway compounding). No chaos, no rent/utilities. Flows to global wallet online (every 10s) + offline.
- Branch upgrade ("Ampliar") cost: `unlockCost * 0.5 * currentLevel`
- Franchise stars: `min(10, floor(sqrt(game.totalMoneyEarned / 8000000)))` (global total, includes passive; capped at 10), each star = +25% income mult (applies to active gym only, not passive branches)
- **Reputation = spendable currency** (Fama system #26). Generated ~97-100% passively (`members × 0.02/s` via `repTick`). It used to be a dead number (its only uses — competition `minRep` gate + a `×0.0001` win-chance bonus — saturate within minutes). Now it's spent in the Fama shop. **Pricing scales with `getReputationPerSecond()`** so items cost a ~constant "minutes of fame" at every level (boosts 10-40min, perks 20-30min L1 ×1.8/lvl, unlocks 2-5h + lifetime gates). The **passive income floor** (`getReputationFloorBonus`, log of lifetime rep, cap +15%/+30%) keeps rep useful even if you don't engage with the shop and rewards the idle loop. `reputationLifetime = reputation + reputationSpent` (spending never lowers the floor). Validate with `tools/sim_reputation.js` + `tools/test_fame.js`.

## Development Conventions
- Language: All UI text in Argentine Spanish (vos form: "comprá", "mejorá", "elegí")
- Functions use camelCase
- CSS uses BEM-ish naming with kebab-case
- No external dependencies besides Firebase SDKs (loaded via CDN)
- Game must work as static files (GitHub Pages compatible)
- No pay-to-win mechanics ever

## Git Workflow
- Single branch: main
- Push to main auto-deploys to GitHub Pages
- Use gh CLI for GitHub operations (installed at "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe")
- PATH needs: `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI"`

## Cache Busting
- Script tags in index.html use `?v=XX` query string (e.g. `js/game.js?v=24`)
- Increment the version number on every deploy that changes JS/CSS so browsers don't serve stale files
- Current version: **v=43**
- Update all 5 script tags together (data, game, ui, systems, auth) + the CSS link (`css/styles.css?v=XX`)

## Planned Improvements (by priority)
### Phase 4 - Social & Meta
- Training programs (assign routines to members)
- Seasonal competition leagues

### Phase 5 - Polish & Endgame
- Multiple simultaneous branches (evolved prestige)
- Sound effects & music
- Income/growth charts
